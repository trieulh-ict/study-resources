# Understanding AWS Interaction

## AWS Interaction Overview
- **Physical vs. Virtual Infrastructure**
  - Physical infrastructure: Directly see and touch servers
  - Virtual infrastructure: Managed logically through APIs

## Main Tools for AWS Interaction
- **AWS Management Console**
  - Web-based interface
  - Allows point-and-click management of services
  - No need for prior knowledge or scripting skills
  - Organized into service categories
  - User-friendly but prone to human error
- **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)**
  - Enables scripting and programming API calls
  - Reduces human error and improves efficiency
  - Uses defined syntax for commands
- **AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)**
  - Integrate application source code with AWS services
  - Provides powerful programming capabilities for managing resources programmatically
